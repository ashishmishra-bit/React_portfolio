    about: 'Hello guys, this is Ashish Kumar Mishra. I am an earnest techie and enthusiast about interests in every new update that comes up. I love to be hardworking and dedicated to whatever I take up as a task. Web development attracts me the most. I have also learned Android Development. Apart from that, I do know about SEO. I have also earned certification in UI/UX. I have also completed 2 projects namely. One of them being a music and billing app for android and the other are 4 to 5 website designs for UI/UX.\n\nThe journey of my B. Tech years have started with these new experiences and I felt a keen interest growing in me. Getting to learn these things have always been worth it. But this is just the beginning. I am always brushing up my skills more to attain perfection. Looking forward to gathering more knowledge and being more accurate in my field.',
